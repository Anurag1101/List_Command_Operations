## Features

The following operations are supported:
- **insert**: Insert a value at a specific index.
- **print**: Display the current list.
- **remove**: Remove the first occurrence of a value.
- **append**: Add a value to the end of the list.
- **sort**: Sort the list in ascending order.
- **pop**: Remove the last element from the list.
- **reverse**: Reverse the order of elements in the list.
